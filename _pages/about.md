Just a your average guy who spends their entire day click clacking and staring at a screen.

I'm an alumni of McGill University, having graduated with a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science, and have previously worked at Amazon in Vancouver, Canada.

In my free time I enjoy studying Machine Learning, Physics and Graphics/Ray Tracing, and prefer to code in C++/Python.
Outside of coding my interests lie all over the place. Doodling, animation, reading, and playing games eat up alot of my free time. And to try and not become a complete potato I regularly power lift, cycle and TKD (3rd dan).

If you have anything interesting in terms of projects, recommendations for games/comics/books/etc. , or some really spicy memes - I'm talking Trinidad Scorpion - feel free to shoot me a message.
